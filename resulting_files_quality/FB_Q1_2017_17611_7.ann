-o-NhtEsTu CLAIM-Fact 751 885 On the engagement front, we're seeing time spent growth per DAU across the Facebook family of apps, and that includes Facebook itself.
IV2prZlgci PREMISE-Fact 886 954 Instagram has been strong, especially with Feed Ranking and Stories.

Uf14cjSrBj NON-ARG 651 688 Can you start with the stats, Wehner?
sOlLBfNgDI CLAIM-Policy 1139 1559 The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses.
FCl2JW5EVS PREMISE-Fact 1738 1919 One is ads that actually display a News Feed, not in Messenger or WhatsApp, but that link to the ability to communicate with a business directly in Messenger or eventually WhatsApp.

uoBU4pAvbY CLAIM-Reformulated 2407 2618 And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.
