jOfLFXsnhp NON-ARG 636 668 Yes, Katy, let me take that one.
QaiwlxqooH NON-ARG 669 785 First of all, when we talk about the services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have.
kUTiD_m_Q9 NON-ARG 1061 1138 And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. 
vIOTSmnXwv NON-ARG 1138 1176 First of all, it's our installed base.
oCbTiSWEHn CLAIM-Fact 1177 1248 As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. 
3SbrLUJfgH CLAIM-Fact 1407 1589 The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly.
VmXMv6FGwf CLAIM-Fact 1621 1674  First of all, we're offering more and more services.
KvexK90pMz CLAIM-Fact 1859 1943 Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores.
5jiO3Vefn9 CLAIM-Fact 2251 2399 Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business and they're growing very well above services average.
XdLzwF7l8j CLAIM-Fact 2744 2803 We are also broadening the scope of many of these services.
WURdDxJomE NON-ARG 3437 3541 I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter.
xjrIpyOHNl NON-ARG 3542 3620 And I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September.
nbejvFRbQz CLAIM-Fact 3621 3915 I think an important point I need to make, and I think it's helpful that you asked the question, is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
_OCVnP1G4s CLAIM-Reformulated 4234 4318 So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification.
u0YYIAoWcd CLAIM-StatisticValue 4319 4410 This factor by itself represents roughly one-third of the deceleration that you're seeing. 
-MSGGmUrJf CLAIM-Reformulated 4523 4576 So that explains about a third of that deceleration. 
lVK-f3AOae CLAIM-Fact 4672 4725 The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. 
aiHE8yHp4U NON-ARG 4858 4956 And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.
v-N93L4X8- CLAIM-StatisticValue 5548 5680 But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.
ERAvQ0zBJk PREMISE-Statistic 786 943 As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal 2016 to 2020, which implied at the time a 19% CAGR.
AByaKbmHa4 CLAIM-Fact 1016 1059 So we are on track to achieve our objective
WOkrAdM9hQ PREMISE-Statistic 1248 1406 It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December and really very little of our services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days.
8pu2-q4CE1 NON-ARG 1590 1621 This is due to several factors.
KMl7jDIZCG PREMISE-RealExample 1675 1810 During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store.
ETwZKZIoVH PREMISE-Fact 1811 1858 All these businesses are growing very strongly.
79h8Qa1WF9 PREMISE-Fact 1944 2046 We accept many more payment methods today which are very common in certain countries around the world.
PB2a5DpAoi PREMISE-Fact 2047 2121 We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services.
BvgwqSnvvd PREMISE-RealExample 2122 2187 We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world.
O5gChsGfOR PREMISE-RealExample 2188 2250 We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on.
FErHb0ZGYX PREMISE-Statistic 2400 2666 And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now.
Xnw-H1Pqef PREMISE-Fact 2667 2743 And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it.
fxEdgfFcql CLAIM-Reformulated 3099 3131 so we are broadening that scope.
xwIHfwLGgj PREMISE-RealExample 2804 2955 If you take Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app.
BU-EVSArvN PREMISE-RealExample 2956 3098 Then we took Apple Pay to Safari, then we started a peer-to-peer service and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter,
i1IN_VQpyi PREMISE-Fact 4062 4233 The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to a growing base.
LqXZcKhWsD CLAIM-Fact 6041 6116 Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program.
tHPtMDiMR9 PREMISE-Statistic 6117 6199 We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program.
B3fV5sl3GD PREMISE-Fact 6200 6315 But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I will say, disciplined manner.
fzoTwQDgsO NON-ARG 6316 6375 And that takes into account also overall market conditions.
mEzdLipoaj NON-ARG 6376 6441 So, that's what we did during the course of the December quarter.
XJJEAZNJQv NON-ARG 6442 6486 We -- our fundamental view remains the same.
ysOjWqj21J CLAIM-Opinion(view) 6487 6569 We are optimistic about our future and we think there is great value in our stock.
iOifOs6AdX NON-ARG 6570 6617 And so we will continue to execute the program.
c1mEZSs4ZM NON-ARG 6618 6673 We will continue to report at the end of every quarter.
LNih-EkcoL NON-ARG 6674 6858 And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.
_s31tlUu5G PREMISE-Fact 3132 3436 And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last three years, we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users and we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.
_m7IiXMgV6 NON-ARG 4576 4671 There are, I would say three factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%.
6Nb4939yr5 PREMISE-Fact 3916 4061 And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under Products and now gets reported under Services.
jNGvaaKHS2 CLAIM-Fact 4957 5027 The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China.
QrJno8hEkx PREMISE-Fact 5028 5078 The App Store in China is a large business for us.
94xEOmTFaL CLAIM-Fact 5213 5548 And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal 2018, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increase the distribution coverage. 
F2KzhHtkMg PREMISE-Fact 5079 5212 We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature, but clearly is affecting our business right now.
ogvpFmETCk NON-ARG 6872 6889  Thank you, Katy.
