wJem-u-Vka NON-ARG 565 589 I can talk about Oculus.
vIoDEAdCm7 NON-ARG 590 681 So the reason why Facebook is excited in this space is I can give you two reasons for this.
q6N-X1hg5o PREMISE-Fact 682 796 One is there's this continued progression of people getting richer and richer ways to share what's on their minds.
ZO0satoqoo PREMISE-Fact 797 877 So if you go back 10 years, most of how people communicated and shared was text.
_0qjm3C1P3 PREMISE-Fact 878 948 We are going through a period where now it's mostly visual and photos.
1UteKzIouu CLAIM-Opinion(view) 949 1069 We are entering into a period where that's going to increasingly be primarily video, and we're seeing huge growth there.
RXbIfRfOao PREMISE-Fact 1070 1105 But that's not the end of the line.
gH2RTi5UOx CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1106 1275 I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video.
Vs7JYU5hkx PREMISE-Fact 1276 1417 So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about.
n86xcvvDmX CLAIM-Reformulated 1418 1445 Video I think will be huge.
oMYC_nYkB0 CLAIM-Reformulated 1446 1489 So just taking that to be 3D and immersive.
cF1bDAxjFX CLAIM-Fact 1490 1510 Gaming will be huge.
LoZoqpi27c PREMISE-Fact 1511 1573 And those are both areas that Facebook has been involved with.
N9iwIwJwxG PREMISE-Fact 1574 1899 Once we start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I just think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well.
m7oHyGSV73 CLAIM-Fact 2546 2598 On Instagram, we are opening up to more advertisers.
dbccB7S0iy PREMISE-Fact 2599 2662 I talked about some of our global rollouts in the past quarter.
q8U2Pn4VaV PREMISE-Fact 2663 2786 We're also opening up more capabilities, which means more formats, like direct response, more ways to buy, like self-serve.
lur2_imHah CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2787 2977 That said, and it's important to understand this, while we think there's a lot of interest and great opportunity, we're going to be really thoughtful and strategic about how we ramp revenue.
oIObwLo6aT PREMISE-Fact 2978 3099 Instagram remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really take time to have significant impact on our growth.
n8qeI6tNLG CLAIM-Fact 1939 2084 So just on the question of how Oculus would affect the cost structure, it's premature for us to be giving guidance on the cost structure in 2016.
8jO0EC6MqQ PREMISE-Fact 2085 2171 But I think one of the things to recognize here is that we're still early with Oculus.
UiwFhYaK04 PREMISE-Fact 2172 2272 We haven't announced any specific plans as it relates to shipment volumes for the consumer for Rift.
v8HZtt8Pos PREMISE-Fact 2273 2321 But we are still early in the development stage,
ddhSHYN876 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2322 2382 so it'd be early to be talking about large volume shipments.
RKbmqBX4Xb PREMISE-Fact 2383 2525 Obviously, we're investing on the research and development side on Oculus in 2015 and that's factored into our expense guidance for this year.
